 * Contains information about an installed SDK, including its base path and the
 * contents of its SDKSettings.plist.
 *
 * SDKs live inside the Xcode application bundle, at subpaths that look like
 * "Contents/Developer/Platforms/XYZ.platform/Developer/SDKs/XYZ.sdk".
 *
 * In addition to the XYZ.sdk directories there may exist directories of the
 * form "XYZversion.sdk", e.g. "WatchOS2.2.sdk".  Sometimes those are symlinks
 * to XYZ.sdk, which seems odd; I'd have expected the symlinks to point in the
 * other direction.  The exception is MacOSX10.11.sdk, which is not a symlink.
 * (This is in Xcode 7.3.1.)

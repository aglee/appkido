//TODO: Why did I have the objects in the group inherit from AKNamedObject instead of conforming to <AKNamed>, which would be more flexible?  Maybe it was just a matter of getting around to it?

//TODO: For AppKiDo I haven't (so far) needed any kind of remove methods, but that could change.

//TODO: Consider "genericizing" so that groups/clusters expect their objects to be of a specific class or protocol.  Benefits?

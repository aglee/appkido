//TODO: Consider adding subscripting syntax.
//TODO: Consider "genericizing".  Could enable having a single class, AKNamedObject, which can have subobjects.  Or maybe AKNamedObject plus just AKNamedObjectGroup, which can behave like AKNamedObjectCluster by having its contained objects be themselves groups.  Not important right now: for now, it's simpler to essentially hard-code the hierarchy I happen to be using, and cluster>group>object is clear in my head, and I don't have to do any casting, e.g. objectWithName: returns an AKNamedObject which I would "know" that I can cast to AKNamedObjectGroup.

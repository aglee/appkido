/*
 * Scans tokens in the DocSetIndex tagged with "C" as their language.  Adds
 * AKToken objects to the database accordingly.  This means C functions,
 * constants, macros (i.e. #defines), enums, and typedefs.  My umbrella term for
 * these token categories is "functions and globals".
 *
 * These categories overlap.  For example, some macros are classified like
 * functions and some like constants.
 *
 * Some constants are NSStrings, so they're not technically "C".  This is a
 * harmless misnomer as far as AppKiDo is concerned.
 *
 * Some globals are documented along with classes and protocols they are closely
 * associated with.  For example, the documentation page for NSWindow has
 * sections for "Data Types", "Constants", and "Notifications".  These tokens
 * are added as pseudo-members of the class or protocol.  All other functions
 * and globals are grouped with the framework they belong to.

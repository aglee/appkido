<h2>Version WIP (Whenevuary 15, 2013)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug where secondary frameworks weren't showing up in the Overview doc list (see NSString -- "AppKit Additions" wasn't showing up).</li>
<li>Option
<li>Split view resizing behavior and use of thin splitters.</li>
<li>The standard Option-Command-H shortcut is now assigned to "Hide Others".</li>
<li>Small buttons changed look.</li>


<li>Code changes (of interest only if you're working on the code):
	<ul>
	<li>Used ARC but went back to non-ARC, so still supports 32-bit.</li>
	<li>Replaced NSEnumeration with fast enumeration everywhere. Probably doesn't make a noticeable difference, but it makes the code seem less ancient.</li>
	<li>Replaced deprecated method calls with their recommended replacements.</li>
	<li>Got rid of the AKFramework class. A simple string containing the framework name is used to indicate membership in a framework.</li>
	<li>Real NSViewControllers and NSWindowControllers, with separate nibs for the various panes.</li>
	<li>NSTabView for the doc view.</li>
	<li>Updated coding conventions (...).</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.994 (February 17, 2013)</h2>
<ul>
<li>(Thanks to Peter Hosey.) In the Dev Tools prefs you now indicate where Xcode.app is, and AppKiDo figures out which type of Xcode you have -- whether it's a standalone Xcode with all the Dev Tools inside it, or the old-style Dev Tools where Xcode is in /Developer/Applications.</li>
<li>Improved handling and reporting of errors that arise from Dev Tools setup.</li>
<li>Added a sanity check for whether the docset needs to be downloaded. If so, an alert appears explaining this fact, and then you get the Dev Tools setup window where you can try selecting a different Xcode installation or a different SDK version. This should reduce the occurrences where AppKiDo launches and the windows don't have any docs in them.</li>
<li>Dropped support for very old Dev Tools installations that don't use docsets. I'm not sure AppKiDo can even run on systems that old any more.</li>
<li>Splash window no longer ties up main thread -- for example you can Quit or Hide Others while it's displaying. Makes accidental launch a bit less annoying.</li>
<li>Edited the credits in the About box.</li>
<li>A little thing -- the About box uses a WebView, which by default has elasticity when you use the trackpad to scroll. Removed that elasticity.</li>
<li>(In case you're wondering, there *was* an 0.993, but I forgot to code-sign it. Many thanks to Rainer Brockerhoff for catching this quickly and for his extremely helpful validation app, <a href="http://brockerhoff.net/RB/AppCheckerLite/">RB App Checker Lite</a>.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.992 (July 25, 2012)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Codesigned, so you can run AppKiDo on Mountain Lion with Gatekeeper in "Mac App Store and identified developers" mode.</li>
<li>Known issue: If you select the 10.8 SDK AppKiDo won't find any docs, because Xcode doesn't (yet) download them locally. You can browse classes, methods, etc., but the doc text pane will be empty.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Version 0.991 (July 24, 2012)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added a system service: "Look Up in AppKiDo". (In AppKiDo-for-iPhone it's "Look Up in AppKiDo-for-iPhone".) See the note below this list for details.</li>
<li>Added a preference for whether a search request via AppleScript or system services opens a new window. Defaults to NO. Previously, a search via AppleScript would always open a new window.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug causing a lot of constants (e.g. NSCocoaErrorDomain) not to appear.</li>
<li>I'm starting to use fast enumeration in the code, which means AppKiDo now requires at least 10.5 (Leopard). I've updated the system requirements on the home page accordingly.</li>
<li>"Check for Newer Version" now connects to appkido.com, the new home for AppKiDo now that MobileMe has been shut down.</li>
<li>"Check for Newer Version" should now work for AppKiDo-for-iPhone. It was broken even before MobileMe was turned off, because a file was missing on the web site.</li>
<li>Links in the About box now connect to appkido.com.</li>
<li>Fixed the AppKiDo-for-iPhone icon so it displays properly on Retina displays. (Only AppKiDo-for-iPhone had this problem.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>About "Look Up in AppKiDo"</h3>

<p>"Look Up in AppKiDo" is a service that you can invoke from any application where you have selected some text. It activates AppKiDo and performs a search for that text.</p>

<p>Often what we want to search for is a method name. AppKiDo tries to help by determining whether the selected text contains an Objective-C message-send or method declaration. If so, it searches for that method name. Otherwise, it searches for the literal text you have selected.</p>

<p>For example, in Xcode if you have <code>[self flyToX:100 y:200 z:300]</code>, you can double-click one of the square brackets to select the whole expression, then invoke this service. AppKiDo will search for the method name <code>flyToX:y:z:</code>.</p>

<p>If you happen to be in BBEdit, where double-clicking a bracket selects the text <i>inside</i> the brackets, the service should still work. If there is leading whitespace or a cast, or newlines or comments anywhere, it should still work, so if you have lines like this you can select them all and then invoke the service:</p>

<pre>
    (void)[self flyToX:100  // cast to void to discard the return value
                     y:200
                     z:900 /*300*/];
</pre>

<p>Note that "Look Up in AppKiDo" doesn't work if there is an assignment in the selected text. For example, it won't work if you select this whole line:</p>

<pre>    BOOL didFly = [self flyToX:100 y:200 z:300];</pre>

<p>The workaround is to select just the message-send -- the part after the "=".</p>

<p>Another intended use is when you're looking at code that <b>declares</b> a method and you want to search for that method name. For example, you can select these lines and it will search for <code>browser:child:ofItem:</code> (the "-<nbsp/>(id)" will be ignored):</p>

<pre>
    - (id)browser:(NSBrowser *)browser
            child:(NSInteger)index
           ofItem:(id)item</pre>

<p>This service assumes well-formed Objective-C. You might get unexpected results otherwise. If there are nested messages, it uses the top-level one. The algorithm mainly looks at punctuation -- delimiters like brackets and a few other characters that need special treatment. The basic idea is that it ignores anything between delimiters, like <code>(blah blah blah)</code>, <code>[blah blah blah]</code>, or <code>{blah blah blah}</code>. For this reason it should work if your selected code contains blocks or the new object literals.</p>

<p>If you use the "Look Up" service, remember to assign a hotkey in System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Services for maximum convenience.</p>

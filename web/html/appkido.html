<!-- ========== WHAT IS APPKIDO? ========== -->
<h2>What is AppKiDo?</h2>

<p>AppKiDo is a free reference tool for Cocoa Objective-C programmers.  Its goal is to help you <font color="RED"><b>find what you want</b></font> in the API documentation for the most commonly used Cocoa frameworks.  AppKiDo parses the header files and the HTML doc files that were installed with your Developer Tools.  It presents the results in a form that is easy to navigate.</p>

<table>

<!-- --- docs --- -->
<tr valign="TOP">
    <td>You can usually navigate to the <font color="RED"><b>specific documentation</b></font> you want with just a few clicks, whether it's for a class, protocol, function, type, or constant.<br></br></td>

    <td><img src="docs.gif"></img><br></br></td>
</tr>

<!-- --- search --- -->
<tr valign="TOP">
    <td>If you're not quite sure what you're looking for, AppKiDo can <font color="RED"><b>search for names</b></font> of API constructs.  Searches are by <font color="RED"><b>substring</b></font>, not keyword.  So, for example, if you're wondering how to manage cursors, search for "cursor".  Apple has conveniently put the word "cursor" in the names of most things related to cursors.<br></br></td>

</tr>

<!-- --- class hierarchy --- -->
<tr valign="TOP">
    <td>AppKiDo presents the <font color="RED"><b>class hierarchy</b></font> in a browser view.  If you are new to Cocoa, browse the class hierarchy to get acquainted with what's there and how it's organized.  If you are more experienced, you can study branches of the hierarchy you never paid attention to before.<br></br></td>

    <td><img src="browser.gif"></img><br></br></td>
</tr>

<!-- --- class hierarchy --- -->
<tr valign="TOP">
    <td>AppKiDo provides handy "<font color="RED"><b>quicklists</b></font>" of logically related groups of classes.  This puts many <font color="RED"><b>frequently used classes</b></font> a click or two away.<br></br></td>

    <td><img src="quicklists.gif"></img><br></br></td>
</tr>

<!-- --- consolidated list --- -->
<tr valign="TOP">
    <td>AppKiDo can display a <font color="RED"><b>consolidated list</b></font> of <font color="RED"><b>all methods</b></font> a class implements, including inherited methods and methods that satisfy a protocol.  This can help you understand the complete behavior of a class.</td>

    <td><img src="consolidated.gif"></img></td>
</tr>

<!-- --- header files --- -->
<tr valign="TOP">
    <td>AppKiDo can open the <font color="RED"><b>.h file</b></font> for any Cocoa class.  Sometimes this comes in handy.</td>

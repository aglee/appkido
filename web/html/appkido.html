<p>I announce new releases on my <a href="http://www.notesfromandy.com/">blog</a> and on the <a href="http://lists.apple.com/mailman/listinfo/cocoa-dev">cocoa-dev</a> mailing list.  If you would like to be personally notified of new releases, or if you have feedback of any kind, let me know at aglee AT earthlink DOT net.  Many thanks to those who have contributed comments, bug reports, and code.</p>

<!-- ========== WHAT IS APPKIDO? ========== -->
<h2>What is AppKiDo?</h2>

<p><b>AppKiDo</b> is a documentation browser for Cocoa and iPhone programmers.  Its goal is to help you <font color="RED"><b>find what you want</b></font> in the API documentation for the most commonly used Objective-C frameworks.  (Pure C frameworks such as Carbon and CoreFoundation are not  supported.)  AppKiDo parses the header files and the HTML doc files that were installed with your Developer Tools.  It presents the results in a form that is <font color="RED"><b>easy to navigate</b></font>.</p>

<p><b>AppKiDo-for-iPhone</b> is identical to AppKiDo (and is built from the same code base), but for iPhone developers.  Note that the iPhone SDK has its own documentation tree, completely separate from the docs for the Mac platform.</p>

<p>Requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mac OS X 10.4.x or higher.</li>
<li>Xcode 2.4.1 or higher.  Xcode 3.x is preferred.</li>
<li>AppKiDo is released as a Universal build.</li>
</ul>

<!-- ========== FEATURES ========== -->
<h2>Features</h2>

<table>

<!-- --- docs --- -->
<tr valign="TOP">
    <td>You can usually navigate to the <font color="RED"><b>specific documentation</b></font> you want with just a few clicks, whether it's for a class, protocol, function, type, or constant.<br></br></td>

    <td><img src="docs.gif"></img><br></br></td>
</tr>

<!-- --- search --- -->
<tr valign="TOP">
    <td>If you're not quite sure what you're looking for, AppKiDo can <font color="RED"><b>search for names</b></font> of API constructs.  So, for example, if you're wondering how to manage cursors, search for "cursor".  Apple has conveniently put the word "cursor" in the names of most things related to cursors.<br></br></td>

    <td><img src="search.gif"></img><br></br></td>
</tr>

<!-- --- class hierarchy --- -->
<tr valign="TOP">
    <td>AppKiDo presents the <font color="RED"><b>class hierarchy</b></font> in a browser view.  You can explore a superclass or subclass with a single click.  If you are new to Cocoa, browse the class hierarchy to get acquainted with what's there and how it's organized.  If you are more experienced, you can study branches of the hierarchy you never paid attention to before.<br></br></td>

    <td><img src="browser.gif"></img><br></br></td>
</tr>

<!-- --- class hierarchy --- -->
<tr valign="TOP">
    <td>AppKiDo provides handy "<font color="RED"><b>quicklists</b></font>" of logically related groups of classes.  This puts many <font color="RED"><b>frequently used classes</b></font> a click or two away.<br></br></td>

    <td><img src="quicklists.gif"></img><br></br></td>
</tr>

<!-- --- consolidated list --- -->
<tr valign="TOP">
    <td>AppKiDo can display a <font color="RED"><b>consolidated list</b></font> of <font color="RED"><b>all methods</b></font> a class implements, including inherited methods, methods that satisfy a protocol, and methods added by a framework other than the class's main framework (for example, the drawing methods that AppKit adds to NSAttributedString).  This can help you understand the complete behavior of a class.<br></br></td>

    <td><img src="consolidated.gif"></img><br></br></td>
</tr>

<!-- --- header files --- -->
<tr valign="TOP">
    <td>AppKiDo can open the <font color="RED"><b>.h file</b></font> for any Cocoa class.  Sometimes this comes in handy.<br></br></td>

    <td><img src="header.gif"></img><br></br></td>

<p>AppKiDo <b>sneakypeeks</b> are works in progress that are not ready for final release.  Sneakypeeks will be larger than official releases, because debug symbols will not have been stripped.  Although they may contain bug fixes and improvements, they may also contain newly added bugs and debugging code that causes them to perform poorly.</p>

<li>Added a nil check that fixed a crashing bug.</li>
<li>In AppKiDo-for-iPhone, I was parsing header files under iPhoneSimulator.platform when it should have been iPhoneOS.platform.  As a result, NSTask was showing up in the class browser even though there is no NSTask on the iPhone.</li>

# AppKiDo

AppKiDo is a browser for the Cocoa documentation that comes with Xcode.  There's a more detailed explanation at [appkido.com](http://appkido.com).  Here's an old screenshot:

AppKiDo stopped working when Xcode 6 was released.  I have resumed work on it, and as of Jun 12, 2016 it is in rough shape, but it runs, and it's able to load Xcode 7 docsets.  Presumably I will find out this week whether it works with Xcode 8.

The code should be considered unstable; I'm still changing a lot of stuff.

This [intro](DevIntro.md) is out of date but gives a general idea of how the code is organized.

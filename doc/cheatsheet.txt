Branch commands:
	git branch
	git branch -r
	git branch $BRANCH_NAME

Deleting a branch:
	git branch -D $BRANCH_NAME
	git push origin :$BRANCH_NAME


---- RELEASE ----

Edit version string in Info.plist, Info-iPhone.plist, InfoPlist.strings
	If going from sneakypeek to official release, remember to just drop the "sp..." suffix; don't increment the version number.
	[agl] Add a note here about the release numbering conventions I'm using.

Update files in the "web" directory
	Update AppKiDo.version with version number
	Update appkido.html, release-notes.html (or sneakypeeks.html, as the case may be), screenshot.html with version number, release notes, and changed links
	Update screenshots if necessary

Do git commit
	Might want to quit Xcode/IB first to be sure there's no unsaved changes.

Do git push origin msater

Tag the release:
	akdtag <version-number>
	Note the actual tag will be release-<version-number>
	Note that we tag after editing the HTML files, since they will be part of the version
	Note that we tag before running akdbuild, since it will do a git clone based on the tag
	[agl] Maybe akdtag could inject the version number into Info.plist etc. and commit before tagging?

Generate the three release tarballs (two for app and one for source)
	akdbuild <version-number>
	This creates ~/AKDBUILD directory, deleting it first if it exists already
	Note that akdbuild renames the src directory to "AppKiDo" so the tarball will untar with that name
	Untar the generated tarballs and run the apps as a sanity check

Upload files to web site
	first the three tarballs
	then any .html files that were edited
	then AppKiDo.version (note this is last; it's used by the "check for new version" feature, so it shouldn't be posted until everything else is in place for the user to actually get the newer version)

Delete obsolete versions from web site (keep a version or two around so people can revert)
	[agl] when I drop 10.4 support, make a note of the last version that supports it

Sanity-check links on HTML pages

Send release email to cocoa-dev if release is significant enough
	Cc individuals who might be interested but not be on cocoa-dev.

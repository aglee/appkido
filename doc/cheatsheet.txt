---- R E L E A S E (the new git way) ----

Edit version string in Info.plist, Info-iPhone.plist, InfoPlist.strings
Update web files
	If a normal release:
		Update AppKiDo.version with version number
		Update appkido.html, release-notes.html, screenshot.html with version number and release notes
		Update screenshots if necessary
	If a sneakypeak:
		Update sneakypeeks.html
Tag the release:
	git branch <release-0.999>
	If need to remove the tag:
		
Commit everything
	(superstition) Quit Xcode first to be sure changes to the xcodeproj get picked up
Generate the three release tarballs (two for app and one for source) using akd-release (run with no args for help)
	Unpack the app and run it as a sanity check
	[agl] akdrelease could be smart and parse version number from Info.plist
Upload files to .Mac
	first the tarballs
	then AppKiDo.version (if it was edited)
	then any .html files that were edited
Delete obsolete versions, if any, from .Mac (should keep a version or two around so people can revert)
	[agl] when I drop 10.4 support, make a note of the last version that supports it
Sanity-check links on HTML pages
Send release email to cocoa-dev if release is significant enough
	Use bcc, then move from Sent mailbox to AppKiDo mailbox
	No longer using the manual mailing list


---- R E L E A S E (the old svn way) ----

Edit version string in Info.plist, Info-iPhone.plist, InfoPlist.strings
Update web files
	If a normal release:
		Update AppKiDo.version with version number
		Update appkido.html, release-notes.html, screenshot.html with version number and release notes
		Update screenshots if necessary
	If a sneakypeak:
		Update sneakypeeks.html
Commit everything
	(superstition) Quit Xcode first to be sure changes to the xcodeproj get picked up
	Can keep the project closed for remaining steps
Tag the release:
	Go to the trunk directory to make sure to get all subdirs
	Run akdtag (run with no args for help)
	(note: should make the script smarter, and have it cd to the dir, and check for uncommitted stuff)
	If need to remove the tag:
		svn rm http://svn.appkido.com/svn/appkido/tags/release-VERSION
Generate the three release tarballs (two for app and one for source) using akdrelease (run with no args for help)
	Unpack the app and run it as a sanity check
	(note: should I also make an svn *checkout* snapshot to make comparisons easier later?  At least get the svn co command for checking out a particular tag)
	(note: akdrelease could be smart and parse version number from Info.plist)
Upload files to .Mac
	first the tarballs
	then AppKiDo.version (if it was edited)
	then any .html files that were edited
Delete obsolete versions, if any, from .Mac (should keep a version or two around so people can revert)
Sanity-check links on HTML pages
Send release email to cocoa-dev and to manual mailing list
	Use bcc, then move from Sent mailbox to AppKiDo mailbox
	(planning to stop using the manual mailing list)

---- R E L E A S E -----
Edit version string in Info.plist, Info-iPhone.plist, InfoPlist.strings, Credits.html
Commit everything
    Close the project in PB, use command line to commit the xcodeproj
    Can keep the project closed for remaining steps
Tag the release using akdtag (run with no args for help)
    (note: should make the script smarter, and have it cd to the dir, and check for uncommitted stuff)
    If need to remove the tag:
        svn rm http://svn.appkido.com/svn/appkido/tags/release-VERSION
Generate the three release tarballs (two for app and one for source) using akdrelease (run with no args for help)
    Unpack the app and run it as a sanity check
    (note: should I also make an svn *checkout* snapshot to make comparisons easier later?  At least get the svn co command for checking out a particular tag)
    (note: akdrelease could be smart and parse version number from Info.plist)
Update web files
    Update AppKiDo.version with version number
    Update appkido.html, release-notes.html, screenshot.html with version number and release notes
    Update screenshots if necessary
Upload files to .Mac
    first the tarballs
    then AppKiDo.version
    then appkido.html, release-notes.html, screenshot.html
    then anything else that was edited
Sanity-check links on HTML pages
Send release email to cocoa-dev and to manual mailing list
    Use bcc, then move from Sent mailbox to AppKiDo mailbox



OLD INSTRUCTIONS (from the CVS days):

Commits within a date range:
    cvs log -d "2007-12-31<2008-01-03"

Tag the release (note dots not allowed in tag name, hence hyphens):
    cvs tag release-#-##
    if a last-minute change is needed after already tagged, can rename/force tag:
        cvs tag -F release-#-##
    if accidentally used bad tag name, can remove it like this:
        cvs rtag -d release-#-## AppKiDo
    there's also the script akdtag that lets you use version number with dots
Create gz file:
    akdstrip <#-##>

To remove a tag:
    cvs rtag -d release-#-## AppKiDo
To check out a tagged version:
    cvs co -r release-#-## AppKiDo
To check out a version by date:
    cvs co -D "2006-01-07" AppKiDo
To export a tagged version:
    cvs export -r release-#-## AppKiDo
To re-import (after deleting/renaming the dir in cvsrepos):
    cvs import -m "Re-import after reorg" AppKiDo AndyLee start

edit version string in the pbxproj file:
	(note: this no longer seems necessary)
    close project in Xcode first
    vi ~/_Developer/CocoaProjects/AppKiDo/AppKiDo.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj

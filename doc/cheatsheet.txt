---- R E L E A S E ----

Edit version string in Info.plist, Info-iPhone.plist, InfoPlist.strings, Credits.html
Update web files
    Update AppKiDo.version with version number
    Update appkido.html, release-notes.html, screenshot.html with version number and release notes
    Update screenshots if necessary
Commit everything
    Quit Xcode and use command line to commit so that changes to the xcodeproj get picked up
    Can keep the project closed for remaining steps
Tag the release using akdtag (run with no args for help)
    (note: should make the script smarter, and have it cd to the dir, and check for uncommitted stuff)
    If need to remove the tag:
        svn rm http://svn.appkido.com/svn/appkido/tags/release-VERSION
Generate the three release tarballs (two for app and one for source) using akdrelease (run with no args for help)
    Unpack the app and run it as a sanity check
    (note: should I also make an svn *checkout* snapshot to make comparisons easier later?  At least get the svn co command for checking out a particular tag)
    (note: akdrelease could be smart and parse version number from Info.plist)
Upload files to .Mac
    first the tarballs
    then AppKiDo.version
    then appkido.html, release-notes.html, screenshot.html
    then anything else that was edited
Delete obsolete versions, if any, from .Mac (should keep a version or two around so people can revert)
Sanity-check links on HTML pages
Send release email to cocoa-dev and to manual mailing list
    Use bcc, then move from Sent mailbox to AppKiDo mailbox
    (planning to stop using the manual mailing list)

:--- APPKIDO TO-DO ---:

----------------------------------------------------------
*** 0.99 stuff (Xcode 3.x only?) ***

[ ] change "doesn't look like dev tools dir" message to be iphone-specific (e.g., maybe you don't have iphone sdk installed?)

[ ] install Xcode 2.5 and 3.1 at home and on Flint

[ ] install iPhone SDK at home

[ ] install iPhone 2.1 SDK on Flint?

[ ] look for [agl] REMOVE

[ ] make sure mailing list has latest people who asked to be on it

===== bugs =====

[ ] when populating "classes with delegates/datasources", check for classes that have *properties* named "delegate"/"datasource"

[ ] iPhone: "Datasource protocols" is missing

[ ] better handling if the user needs to update their docs

===== efficiency =====

[ ] store stuff on disk so it doesn't have to be reparsed
	* overhaul data model to be more CoreData-friendly (and possibly more generic so it can be applied to other languages/frameworks someday)
	* use CoreData to store

[ ] parse faster
	* write new pure-C parser, use different strategy
	* have list of HTML tags I care about, and attributes within those tags, and in the special case of tags that I designate as "header" tags (h1, h2, etc. but could also include 
	* pluck out byte offsets of where those tags begin and end, and their values for those attributes (in particular, the "name" attribute for anchor tags)
	* output of parsing one file is an ordered list of these byte offsets
	* create a mini-language for querying this list for a range of bytes satisfying some criterion (in particular, the range of bytes containing the documentation for a token that is identified by a given anchor string)

[ ] parse less stuff
	* among HTML files, only need to parse class docs (to get delegate methods and notifications); everything else we can tell from the docset index
	* can we count on the doc file itself to tell us a protocol is informal?  if so, may not need to parse headers

[ ] parse _more_ stuff
	* CoreFoundation?

[ ] save less stuff in memory
	* query on an as-needed basis from the docset index and the CoreData storage instead of storing everything in memory


===== cosmetics =====

[ ] new icons
[ ] clean up window layout -- overlapping views, etc.
	[ ] put a splitter in the middle section
[ ] make the iPhone version visually distinctive
	[ ] somehow parametrize the UI (different background colors, etc.)
	[ ] create alternate icon for the iPhone version
[ ] nicer credits: bold names and list them alphabetically (perhaps with version number?)
[ ] progress indicator during search
[ ] "Open Page in Browser" should be "Open Page In Browser"
[ ] disable contextual menu items when there is no doc


===== dev stuff =====

[ ] prune away code that supported the old way of parsing
[ ] clean up copyrights
[ ] change hosting?
[ ] put the TESTING_PERFORMANCE #ifdef (or whatever it's called) in the Xcode "Development" configuration instead of hand-toggling it
[ ] use that other method for opening in browser (it's in NSWorkspace)


----------------------------------------------------------

[ ] QCComposition -> instance methods -> protocols -> link to "Standard Protocols" opens web page; maybe because of the space which gets converted to an underscore in the URL?

[ ] make sure handling errors querying sqlite -- note Tony Cate's problem

[ ] fix splitview problems reported by Gerriet

[ ] figure out discrepancies between 972j and 972k

[ ] review: 972j.xml has substantial differences from 972g.xml, and ABAddressBookRef shows up twice

[ ] have new windows cascade

[ ] "Classes in AppKit" doesn't include NSString

[ ] NSObject -> Instance Methods shows [Foundation] next to every method

[ ] would be nice to see header file containing functions / globals

[ ] some way to convert between file:// URLs and http:// URLs
	* could drag from doc list into email and get the http:// URL
	* could drag from cocoa-dev message into AppKiDo and navigate to the right doc

[ ] ApplicationServices -> Types & Constants -> Constants -- "Color Modes" appears twice, as does "Color Constants"

[ ] consider putting declarations of private methods at the bottom of the public .h instead of the top of the .m, where they get in the way

[ ] put overrides in .h and give them headerdoc comments

[ ] instead of kludging around css stuff, use the Apple stylesheet

[ ] consider giving AKGlobalsNode an ivar indication the behavior it's associated with (if any) instead of shoving the behavior name into the AKGlobalsNode name

[ ] reconcile use of platform names as parameters with use of APPKIDO_FOR_IPHONE macro -- do I need to do both?

[ ] [AKDocParser parseToken] treats bytes with high bit set as whitespace; works for now, but may someday have to properly handle charsets and encodings

[ ] would startup be noticeably faster if AKDocSetIndex kept the database open all the time instead of opening and closing for each query?

[ ] NSResponder -> acceptsFirstResponder -> YES opens browser window

[ ] CGDisplayCurrentMode -> CFDictionaryRef opens browser (CoreFoundation)

[ ] remember scroll position in history

[ ] in topic browser, select NSWindow and then NSViewController -- does a weird sideways scrolling thing, and the horizontal scroller doesn't update

[ ] SubEthaEdit search Service only hits Mac OS ("classic") AppKiDo

[ ] why does it take so long to load AddressBook -> Protocols -> <ABImageClient>?

[ ] why do some searches take so long?  "cursor" is slow, yet "o" is fast even though it returns a superset of results
	* clue: I think it's the "<<" characters that get drawn in the search results

[ ] odd -- the small dividers for the split views aren't small

[ ] fuzzy table contents -- double drawing?
	* seems to have been fixed when I stopped using ak_stripHTML on the strings we display in the doc list
	* oops, that didn't really fix the bug, yet for some reason it seems better

[ ] AddressBook -> Types & Constants -> shows a "Constants" subtopic with no docs

[ ] possible confusion: in AppKit Constants, there's "Cell Types [NSCell]" and "NSCellType [NSCell]"; perhaps no more confusing than the NSCell doc itself -- except they're so far apart in the doc list it may not be clear they're related; maybe should reorg so "Constants" and "Data Types" are separate topics -- this would allow another level of subdivisions

[ ] show progress indicator during search, number of results when done

[ ] lower the memory profile

[ ] look into Spaces bug

[ ] Use RBSplitView.

[ ] if you hide quicklist, move window near left edge of screen, and restore quicklist, the window should be pushed right to make room for the whole quicklist to be visible

[ ] Favorites menu shouldn't just say "add Functions to favorites"; should be "add AppKit Functions to favorites"

[ ] make sure breaking delegate and notification connections in dealloc, as I argued one should
[ ] check for memory leaks in general

[ ] prefs "use default appearance" is buggy

[ ] possible radar: request performSelector:afterDelay: (without a withObject:)
[ ] report objective c typo in text submenu

[ ] why isn't "NSAttributedString Application Kit Additions Reference" showing up in the General doc list for NSAttributedString?  (It doesn't in 0.971 either)

[ ] in splash screen, don't say parsing framework unless it exists (e.g. UIKit for Mac OS)

[ ] review behaviorDocPathsForFramework

[ ] AKPropertiesSubtopic should be an AKRealMethodsSubtopic (for behavior, not just class)

[ ] equivalent of "view classes" is what for uikit?

[ ] rename fromPrefDictionary: to xxxFromPrefDictionary: in various classes

[ ] why is Carbon showing up???

[ ] should [self release] be [[super init] release]?

[ ] ping Cathy re: subversion, and UI question re: iPhone support

[ ] could CoreFoundation work?

[ ] had an idea once upon a time to offer the option of small-style contextual menus

[ ] quicklist includes NSButton among classes with delegates, but it doesn't technically have one
	[ ] WebView does not appear in list of classes with delegates

[ ] maybe force-exclude XgridFoundation from frameworks, as with Carbon?

[ ] put web site into svn

[ ] maybe move hosting to Dreamhost to get better stats etc.?

------------------

[ ] go back to [AKDatabase defaultDatabase]
	* possibly pull _database out of AKTopic
	* hm -- why did I want to do this?  it was to prevent AKClassNode from having to know about AKAppController

[ ] cell classes are n/a for iPhone (UITableViewCell is actually a view)

[ ] add some UI to choose which iPhone SDK to use -- a tab in the prefs panel that only appears in iPhone mode

[ ] subtopic list should scroll to visible, e.g., if you search for NSNextMapEnumeratorPair, "Managing Map Tables" is far down the subtopic list and isn't visible

[ ] script to go through and make sure all imports are actually necessary

[ ] in Xcode, search for "setTimeOffset:" finds the *property* timeOffset

[ ] can DIGSLogExitingMethodPrematurely take varargs?

[ ] shouldn't use Command-+ to add column; it's standard for increasing font size

[ ] check whether .h parser handles class extensions
	* _are_ there any extensions I need to parse?

[ ] add the ability to look things up / do searches in the Xcode doc window

[ ] I think can stop parsing headers when docset queries fully fleshed out

[ ] why sometimes slow to jump to a favorite?

[ ] do a screencast

[ ] technical meaning of "member"?

[ ] make the splash panel a cancellable modal panel

[ ] get rid of "shadowing" warnings

[ ] use Sparkle for updates

look into log4cocoa

support wildcards in search string
	support multiple search strings?

show feedback during search
	show number of search results

* akd prefs frameworks space bar doesn't work to toggle selection

get latest fmdb

show which OS version deprecated methods were deprecated in

make sure parsing class extensions

rename digitalspokes plist
	maybe try to get the domain name back?

AddressBook constants not appearing in 980, but they do in 971

QTKit types and constants contains only a "Constants" group in 980, only a "Data Types" group in 971; the subnodes of the two groups are disjoint

weirdness if browsing e.g. CoreData Constants and click on one of the clickable constants -- see what happens to topic browser

use NSUInteger

search for "::" doesn't find -[CIImageProvider provideImageData:bytesPerRow:origin::size::userInfo:]

hm, *Carbon* is showing up, with two protocols: IMKTextInput and IMKUnicodeTextInput; and the -insertText: method for the latter is not showing up (not documented, I assume)

omit frameworks with no classes from the quicklist popup

use tabview for the doc view

check out latest fmdb

open link in new window doesn't work (e.g., runModalForWindow: links to stopModal)
	- New window doesn't do anything either

*** Done in 0.982 ***

[x] Added nil check in case couldn't load a file, e.g., if there's a bug in the sqlite database and it has an incorrect wrong file path, or if the sqlite database somehow gets out of sync with what's on disk.  Might there also be a problem if the user has only just installed AppKiDo and hasn't downloaded all the local files yet?

[x] Guillaume writes: "In NSIndexPath, there is a NSIndexPath UI Kit Additions.  It's not listed in AppKido."
	* The fix was to tweak the logic in AKCocoaBehaviorDocParser for deciding whether a file contains the class's "main" reference.  I was checking for "...Additions Reference" in the title, and the doc Guillaume referred to is called "NSIndexPath UIKit Additions" (without the word "Reference").

[x] When populating "classes with delegates/datasources", check for classes that have *properties* named "delegate"/"datasource", and also whether protocol ThisClassDelegate/ThisClassDataSource exists.

[x] iPhone: "Datasource protocols" is missing
	* ? I see two datasource protocols.

[x] UITextField's delegate methods aren't documented in the class doc file -- they're in the doc for UITextFieldDelegate.
	* Fix: added logic to _addExtraDelegateMethodsTo: to see if there exists a protocol named ThisClassDelegate.

[x] application:printFiles: -- doc list shows "application:printFiles: <(null)>"
	* Fix: was missing a call to setOwningBehavior: when adding deprecated delegate method.  Changed AKMemberNode to take owningBehavior in its designated initializer, and got rid of setOwningBehavior:.

[x] Spaces bug: always creates a new window when switch to AppKiDo and it's in a different space.
	* Fix: replaced applicationDidBecomeActive: with applicationShouldHandleReopen:hasVisibleWindows: (as suggested by Christiaan Hofman) because it seems more in line with what other apps do, though personally I think it's odd because it only handles reopening by relaunching or clicking on Dock, and not Command-Tab switching as applicationDidBecomeActive: does.

[x] Moved akdtag and akdrelease scripts to the svn tree, and updated them to use svn instead of cvs.
